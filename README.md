# Elizabeth Chan - Thesis Project 
------------------------------------

This is a Chrome extension that can be used to contextualize HTML code. Its purpose is for people who are visually-impaired/blind and would like to use the [w3schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) as a resource to learn HTML. The screen reader, ChromeVox, can be used to test to see how the speech differentiates before the HTML is processed by the extension and after it is processed. 


Installing this extension from source:
------------------------------------

1. Go to Extensions in Chrome
2. Turn "Developer mode" on
3. Click "Load unpacked extension" and (after downloading the zip file or cloning it from the Gitub repo) point it to the folder "ElizabethChan-ContextualizeHTML"
4. Go to https://www.w3schools.com/ and click on the icon designated for this chrome extension (looks like computer screen with a </> tag). You can toggle what kind of output you would like to see (different levels of abstraction from the baseline examples) through the pop up menu that drops down from the Chrome extension icon.
